# Interactive-Form

Using JavaScript to make a form more user-friendly by adding customized, conditional behavior and interactivity and by validating user input, providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

Form validation error indications occur in real-time as the user interacts with the form fields.

Error messages are conditional for the "Name" and "Email Address" input fields. One error message is for when the field is empty and the other is for when it is not formatted correctly.
